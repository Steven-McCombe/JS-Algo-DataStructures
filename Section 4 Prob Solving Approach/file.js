//What is an algorithm?
//A process or set of steps to accompolish a certain task.

//Almost everything you do in programing involves some kind of algorithm.

//How do you improve?
//1. Devise a plan for solving problems.
//2. Master common problem solving problems. 

//Problem solving strategies
//1. Understand the Problem
//2. Explore concrete examples
//3. Break it down
//4. Solve/Simplify the problem
//5. Look back and refactor

//--------------UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM -------------
//Reference Book - George Polya - How to solve it
//1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
//2. What are the inputs that go into the problem
//3. WHat are the outputs that should come from the solution.
//4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, Do I have enough information to solve.
//5. How should i label the important pieces.

// Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum.
//1. Implement Addition
//2. ints, floats, string?
//3. ints float string?
//4. What happens if they only give us one number, or more than two
//5. Input, addition, total


//-------------- EXPLORE CONCRETE EXAMPLES -------------
//Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better.
// Examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should. 
// User Stories, Unit Tests.

// Start with simple examples.
// Progress to more complex examples
// Explore ecamples with empty inputs
// Explore ecamples with invalid inputs

//Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string.

charCount("aaaa"); //{a:4}
charCount("hello"); //{h:1, e:1, l:2, o:1}


//-------------- BREAK IT DOWN -------------
//Take the steps of the problem and write them down. Pseudocode. 
// Explicitly write out the steps you need to take. - This forces you to think about the code before you write it. 
// It also helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before you dive in. 

//-------------- SOLVE/SIMPLIFY THE PROBLEM -------------
//-------------- LOOK BACK AND REFACTOR -------------
